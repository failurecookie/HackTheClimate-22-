I found out about MEGAHACK'22, where I began developing a application to help stop climate change by reducing the amount of fossil energy released by the general public. Hopefully, this application will help bring a halt to climate change! You can contact me at <a href = "mailto: eyip28@rutgersprep.org">eyip28@rutgersprep.org</a>!</div>
